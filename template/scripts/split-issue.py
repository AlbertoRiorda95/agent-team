"""Split one issue into task issues, one per role.

Works with any tracker of scripts/agentteam (GitHub, GitLab, local files, Jira,
Linear, Redmine).

Two steps, with your approval in between:
  1. propose: the plan (written by Claude or by you) is checked and posted as a
     comment on the issue. Nothing is created.
  2. create: after your approval ("@claude ok" on GitHub, SPLIT_CONFIRM on
     GitLab, or your yes in the conversation), this script creates exactly the
     plan of the latest proposal comment, as sub-issues of the issue in its
     milestone. The model is not involved in this step.

A task can depend on a task of another issue's plan: "depends_on": ["12:api"].
Split issue 12 first; create on this issue refuses while that task does not exist.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/split-issue.py check   <plan.json>
  python3 scripts/split-issue.py propose <issue> <plan.json>
  python3 scripts/split-issue.py create  <issue> [--team]

The plan format is described in scripts/agentteam/plans.py. The created issues
get no labels: start each task with agent:<role> or scripts/dispatch.py. Running
create twice creates nothing new (tasks are recognized by their key). Only a
proposal posted by a bot or by you counts, never one pasted by someone else.
