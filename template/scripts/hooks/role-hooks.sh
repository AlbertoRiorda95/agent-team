# (how the CI runs a role). The lead session has none, and none of these apply.
# They live here, not in the agents' frontmatter, because Claude Code skips
# frontmatter hooks in a folder that is not trusted, which is every headless run.
# A role this project does not have has no script, and nothing runs.
